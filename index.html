  Think of these thoughts as limitless light<br>
Exposing closing circuitry of fright<br>
Think of each moment holding this breath<br>
As death minute in decimal<br>
Resident minor, how do you plead?<br>
We'll need your testimony on the stand<br>
Solemnly swear to tell the whole truth<br>
So help you son, now raise your right hand<br>
Father your honor, may I explain?<br>
My brain has claimed its glory over me<br>
I've a good heart albeit insane<br>
Condemn him to the infirmary<br>
All mine towers crumble down the flowers gasping under rubble<br>
Shrieking in the hall of lull, thy genius saves a thirst for trouble<br>
Scattering sparks of thought energy<br>
Deliver me and carry me away<br>
Here in my kingdom I am your Lord<br>
I order you to cower and pray<br>
Nuns commence incanting as the lightning strikes mine temples thus<br>
Electrifying mine chambers, wholly scorching out thine sovereignty<br>
So-so-so-so-so-so-so-so spiraling down thy majesty<br>
I beg of thee, have mercy on me<br>
I was just a boy you see<br>
I plead of thee have sympathy for me<br>
See how the serfs work the ground (see how they fall)<br>
And they give it all they've got (fall)<br>
And they give it all they've got (fall)<br>
And you give it all you've got 'til you're down (fall)<br>
See how the brain plays around<br>
And you fall inside a hole you couldn't see<br>
And you fall inside a hole inside a-<br>
Someone help me<br>
Understand what's going on inside my mind<br>
Doctor I can't tell if I'm not me<br>
When it grows bright, the particles start to<br>
Marvel having made it through the night<br>
Never they ponder, weather electric<br>
Calming if you look at it right!<br>
